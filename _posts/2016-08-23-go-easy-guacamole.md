# Go Easy Guacamole
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9271a853-fbdc-4bfa-8fb8-786623eaa8ce.jpg)

INGREDIENTS

2 ripe avocados  
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice  
1/4 teaspoon Pink Himalayan salt,  
Pepper, to taste  
1 medium tomato diced to preferred size  
1/2 small onion, finely chopped  
2 tablespoons fresh cilantro leaves chopped  
1 clove garlic, minced

_To change it up a little and add some spice, substitute the 1 medium tomato with a can of Rotel (drained). I like the hot kind but you can use the mild if your heat tolerance is less._

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Peel and pit the avocados and place in a bowl.
2. Pour in lime juice and sprinkle in the salt and pepper then mash with fork (we find it easier to use a potato masher)
3. Add remaining ingredients and stir thoroughly
4. Enjoy! (You can also place in fridge for 30 minutes to let flavors settle together)
